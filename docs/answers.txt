1. Console output from step 3.c: On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

2. Total Commits: 9
git rev-list --count HEAD

3.Last modification date of README.md:
Fri Feb 28 16:44:47 2025 -0500
git log -1 --format=%cd -- README.md

4.Two reasons for using branches:
Allows parallel development
Helps manage feature releases without affecting main code

5.Difference between `git log` and `git status`:
`git log`: Shows commit history.
`git status`: Shows current file changes.

6.Command to see commits modifying `Vehicle.h`:
git log --oneline -- Vehicle.h

7. Command to find commits with "file" in message:
git log --grep="file"

8. Object-Oriented Programming:
Inheritance: A class derives from another class.
Polymorphism: One function, multiple implementations.
Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to class internals.

9. Difference Between “Dictator and Lieutenants” Workflow and “Integration Manager” Workflow
Integration Manager Workflow: Developers push to their own public repositories and pull from the central repository. A single integration manager reviews and merges changes.
Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow: Developers push to lieutenant repositories. Lieutenants handle merges for groups of developers before sending the final changes to the dictator, 
who integrates everything into the central repository.

10. Why "Dictator and Lieutenants" is Better for a Large Team
Scales better for large teams by distributing responsibilities.
Reduces bottlenecks, as lieutenants handle merging before the dictator integrates final changes.
Minimizes conflicts by having structured merge points instead of everyone pushing to a single repository.
